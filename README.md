# installation 

To use this website you open the GitHub page URL, I recommend Google Chrome, then right click anywhere on the screen, then click inspect, A new side window will open, navigate to the console section. This will then display similar to the screen shot below. To view the profit months and data you will need to expand by clicking on the small arrow next to the words: "Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses:".
